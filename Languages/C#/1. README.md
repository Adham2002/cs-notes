# 
These notes should give a complete reference guide for basic programming in C#

## C# properties
Multi paradigm – Supports OO, functional, imperative, and component-oriented programming
Statically typed - Everything has a type at compile-time
Strongly typed – Implicit type conversions are limited + type safety is enforced
Type safe – Prevents unsafe casts, buffer overruns, and uninitialized variable use (unless explicitly using unsafe)
Memory safe by Default – Automatic memory management with garbage collection.
First class OO - Everything derives from System.Object. Supports encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism
Asynchronous programming model – async/await for structured concurrency and asynchronous I/O
Managed language – Runs on the .NET CLR, with garbage collection and runtime services


## Navigating notes
Basics - contains the common built in functionality of C#. That is things that don't require imports
    1. Variable & Data Types - how to create and use variable of different data types
    2. Flow control - how to change the normal sequential flow of the compiler including error handling and asynchronicity 
    3. OOP and Functions - 
    Misc - everything else
